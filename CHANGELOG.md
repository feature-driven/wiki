> **Note**  
> This release note is retrospective, meaning that prior to this release, the Feature-Sliced Design project did not keep a changelog. Below is a summary of the most prominent recent changes, but there is no FSD v1. Prior to FSD, there has been a project called ["Feature Slices"](https://featureslices.dev/v1.0.html), and it is considered to be the v1 of FSD.

### Deprecated

- The **Processes** layer is now deprecated. If you're using this layer, consider moving the code to the **Features** layer, with the help of the **App** layer if you need to access pages.
